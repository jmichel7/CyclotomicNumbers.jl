# CyclotomicNumbers

This  package deals with cyclotomic numbers,  the complex numbers which are
linear  combinations  of  roots  of  unity,  usually  with with rational or
integer  coefficients; but it is possible to use any coefficients `<:Real`.
Cyclotomic numbers can be converted to `Complex` numbers and conversely.

See the docs for usage and comparison with `Cyclotomics.jl`.
